# Lighthouse Labs Lotide Project

 This project is based on the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) library and is essentially a reimagined version of the Lodash library, in a simpler format.
 
 Below is a list of functions and what they do :

 * countLetters : counts the amount of letters in a string
 * countOnly : Looks through an object and counts how many instances of a property appear
 * eqArrays : compares 2 arrays to see if they are equal
 * eqObjects : compares 2 objects to see if they are equal
 * findKey : looks through an object with a property and returns that property's key
 * findKeyByValue : looks through an object by searching for the value and returning the key
 * flatten : turns a multdimensional array into a flat, 1 dimensional array
 * head : finds and returns the head of an array
 * index : list of all functions in the lotide library, can be exported 
 * letterPositions : given a letter, it returns the position(s) of said letter in a string
 * map : maps and returns the start of strings , etc
 * middle : returns the middle of a given array
 * tail : returns the end or tail of a given array
 * takeUntil : Takes in an array and a point to stop, and returns a new array with everything until the stop point
 * without : takes in an array and removes elements not needed, and returns a new array with elements removed
